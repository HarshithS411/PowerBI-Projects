1. Overall Sales Trends:
	• Show me the overall trend of tree sales over the years. I'd like to see if there's any seasonality or year-over-year growth.
	• Can we divide the data by "Type of tree" to see how specific species perform over time?

2. Revenue Insights:
	• Can you visualize the total sales and average tree price per year? I want to understand the relationship between volume and 	revenue.
	• It would be great to see a breakdown of sales by "Type of tree" to identify the most profitable species.

3. Sales Performance Comparison:
	• Can we compare the sales performance of different tree types? A bar chart or grouped line chart could be helpful here.
	• If possible, I'd like to see a comparison of sales across different months or quarters to identify peak selling seasons.

4. Targeting and Planning:
	• Based on the data, can you help me identify the types of trees with the highest growth potential or those that might be 	underperforming?
	• I'd appreciate insights into seasonal trends and upcoming holidays to inform my inventory stocking and marketing strategies.

5. Interactive Features:
	• If possible, I'd love to have interactive elements like filters and drill-down options to explore the data in more detail.
	• For example, being able to filter by specific tree types or regions would be incredibly valuable.

6. Presentation and Design:
	It's important for me to easily understand the data and share it with colleagues or potential investors. Please present the 	information in a visually appealing and easy-to-digest format.
